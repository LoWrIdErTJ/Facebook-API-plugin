1. Have access to the Graph Explorer
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer

2. The user must have previously set all permissions (checkbox all permissions) and obtain a token from the above Graph Explorer (this sets the permissions on teh account to use the api and allows the plugin to reach the proper token type.

Then the $fb api http graph token
will get the token on request.
